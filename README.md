### What is this project?
Helcom was a front-end design & development coding challenge for Helcim, a Canadian Fintech startup.
While I didn't get the job, I wanted to show off the work I put in to making an impression on their team.

This is mainly meant as a mobile experience.
The original design done in Figma can be found below.
