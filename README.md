# Helcom - Social Media Design & Development

If you'd like to visit the experience, [click here](https://rida.dev/helcom)

Helcom was a front-end design & development coding challenge for the company "Helcim."
While I didn't get the job, I did put quite a bit of work into both the design and development, and as a result, decided to share it!

This is mainly meant as a mobile experience. 
As a result, the best UX will be on mobile, however there is desktop functionality just in case of any desktop evaluations.

The original design done in Figma can be found below.
